# Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is intentionally deferred.

## Rationale

DI depends on:
- Stable routing semantics
- Stable handler signatures
- Clear request lifecycle

Introducing DI too early would compromise architectural clarity.

DI will be added once core semantics are fully locked.
