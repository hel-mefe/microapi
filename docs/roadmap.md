# Roadmap

Planned development milestones:

1. HTTP method semantics (404 vs 405)
2. Middleware system
3. Application lifespan events
4. Route decorators (`@get`, `@post`)
5. Dependency Injection
6. Typed path and query parameters
7. Static file support

Each feature will be added incrementally without breaking existing abstractions.
