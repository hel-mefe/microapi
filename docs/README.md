# MicroAPI Documentation

This directory contains the internal technical documentation for **MicroAPI**.

The goal of this documentation is to explain **how the framework works internally**, not how to use it at a high level. Each document focuses on architectural decisions, invariants, and implementation details.

This documentation is intended for:
- Framework authors
- Backend engineers interested in web framework internals
- Readers exploring ASGI-based systems design
